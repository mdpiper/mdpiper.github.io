I'm a research software engineer with over 20 years of experience
developing geoscientific software
in multiple languages on desktop, cloud, and HPC systems.

I currently work in the NSF-funded
[Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System](https://csdms.colorado.edu) (CSDMS).
We produce open-source model coupling cyberinfrastructure
that transforms models written in C, C++, Fortran, and Python into
plug-and-play components through a standards-based workflow.

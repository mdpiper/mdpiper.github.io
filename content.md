I'm a research software engineer with over 20 years of geoscientific software
development experience in multiple languages on desktop and HPC systems.

I'm currently one of two developers in the NSF-funded [Community Surface Dynamics
Modeling System](https://csdms.colorado.edu) (CSDMS). We produce an open-source model coupling
cyberinfrastructure that transforms models written in Fortran, C, and C++ into
plug-and-play Python components through a jinja-templated, Cython-based
workflow.

## Software

I've contributed to the following software projects
(some more than others; check the GitHub stats for my contributions).

* The [Basic Model Interface](https://github.com/csdms/bmi) (BMI) standard
    * [Documentation](https://bmi.readthedocs.io/) (written in Sphinx, hosted on Read The Docs)
    * Language bindings:
        * [bmi-c](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-c)
        * [bmi-cxx](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-cxx)
        * [bmi-fortran](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-fortran)
        * [bmi-java](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-java)
        * [bmi-python](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-python)
    * Conda recipes for the Fortran, C, C++, and Python language bindings on [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge?q=bmi&type=&language=)
    * Sample implementations of the BMI, using a simple diffusion model:
        * [bmi-example-c](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-example-c)
        * [bmi-example-cxx](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-example-cxx)
        * [bmi-example-fortran](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-example-fortran)
        * [bmi-example-python](https://github.com/csdms/bmi-example-python)
    * The [BMI v2.0 paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02317) in the *Journal of Open Source Software*
* babelizer
* pymt


## Presentations

This is a selection of recent presentations.
I tend to give fewer lectures and more interactive workshops.

* [BMI Live!](https://github.io/csdms/bmi-live), an interactive workshop on
  adding a BMI to a model
* [Dakota seminar](https://mdpiper.github.io/dakota-seminar), a lecture on the
  [Dakota](https://dakota.sandia.gov) iterative systems analysis toolkit
* [ATOC IDL seminar](https://mdpiper.github.io/ATOC-IDL-seminar), clinic for
  CU-ATOC grad students

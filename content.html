<p>Iâ€™m a research software engineer with over 20 years of experience
developing geoscientific software in multiple languages on desktop,
cloud, and HPC systems.</p>
<p>I currently work in the NSF-funded <a
href="https://csdms.colorado.edu">Community Surface Dynamics Modeling
System</a> (CSDMS). We produce open-source model coupling
cyberinfrastructure that transforms models written in C, C++, Fortran,
and Python into plug-and-play components through a standards-based
workflow.</p>
